# **Let's get started!**
* Define your audience and goals
* Generate ideas, prototype, and test
* What you need to know about designing for web

***

# **Why are you doing this?**

**Every time you start a project,** make sure you know:
* Who your **users** are
* What your **goals** are

***

# **What are the goals of your project?**
* Can be about business
* Can be about users/experience
* Either way, clearly define them and decide which are most important

***

# **Who are your users?**
**Personas** - help give “personality” to the audiences you’re working with, and help you step into their shoes while you design

***

# **Be specific**
* What is their background?
* What are they worried about?
* Why are they coming to your site?
* What sort of situations could they be in when they come to your site?

***

# **How do you get people to go to the gym?**

***

# **Always let your goals and personas be your guide***
* Does what I’m doing help accomplish the goals?
* How will my users react to the changes I’m making?
* Would it make sense to them? Are the changes clear and easy to understand?

# **Try it: Create a user profile**
Take the next 10 minutes to create a user profile. Pick one of the following categories to start:

* Music
* Finance
* Education

Imagine a solveable problem someone might have related to one of these three categories. Then, write a brief user profile for that person. Consider listing things such as their background, education, how familiar they would feel with the subject, and whether or not they feel good about it and why. If you like, you can base this profile on yourself or someone you know.

When you are finished, jot down a few things that could help make their problem easier.

**How we did it:**
# **Boston University Fitness & Recreation Center**
http://www.bu.edu/fitrec/

***

# **Goal 1: Make navigation less confusing**
Where would you go if you wanted to learn more about Pilates?
[See if you can figure it out.](https://web.archive.org/web/20120710050037/http://www.bu.edu/fitrec/)

![Old site](http://cl.ly/image/0H473r2M1X2B/Screen-Shot-2015-03-16-at-9.52.41-PM.jpg)

***

# **Is it *clear and easy* to get to pilates classes?**

***

# **Solution: Use words and categories the user uses**

![FitRec New navigation](http://cl.ly/image/1F03160I1L0o/Screen-Shot-2015-03-16-at-10.00.07-PM.jpg)

***

# **Goal 2: Make important information easy to access**
You want to go to FitRec today. What do you need to know before you leave?

***

# **You'd want to know**
* What are the hours?
* How do I get there?
* Where can I park?

***

# **Traditional design approach:**
Make a utility nav

![utility](http://cl.ly/image/2F2L0J1v0k3r/Screen-Shot-2015-03-16-at-10.02.40-PM.jpg)

***

# **Nontraditional design approach:**
Today at FitRec panel

![today1](http://cl.ly/image/1w102S3A1T1C/Screen-Shot-2015-03-16-at-10.04.59-PM.jpg)

***

# **Problem: Not all FitRec users have BU logins**
The biggest FitRec audiences are BU students, faculty and staff - *but* you can get in if you know someone at BU or are visiting BU, which means not everyone has a BU login.

How can we make the difference between the two login types clear with design and content?

***

# **How we solved it**
[My FitRec Login Page](https://myfitrec.bu.edu/wbwsc/webtrac.wsc/wb1000.html?wbp=2&id=login)
* Make the main login clear and prominent - if this doesn't apply to you, you'll continue to scroll
![login1](http://cl.ly/image/2d3n1Z2S3R3w/Screen-Shot-2015-03-16-at-10.09.30-PM.jpg)

***

**For those who don't have a BU login:**
* Re-explain BU logins in friendly terms
* Tell the user what the account is for and make sure they need it
![login2](http://cl.ly/image/0Z2G2T1Z2J0I/Screen-Shot-2015-03-16-at-10.09.30-PM.jpg)

***

# **Bonus! Prepare your users for a long and tedious form!**
* Tell them what they need to have ready to complete the form
* Use reassuring language that makes it sound easier than it is
* Reinforce the “easy” feel with visuals associated with simple step-by-step processes: in this case, checkmarks

![form](http://cl.ly/image/1G2H1Z3Z3o1n/Screen-Shot-2015-03-16-at-10.09.30-PM.jpg)

***

# **So after all that… how did users react?**

***

# **Pretty well!**
People were very positive and excited after we launched, and overall we saw a slight uptick in pageviews, average time on page, while the exit rate lowered.
![analytics](http://cl.ly/image/231E03210T0m/Screen%20Shot%202015-03-17%20at%2010.00.10%20AM.png)

***

# **However...**
After the launch, some users reported not noticing the "featured" (photo) item in the dropdowns, and skipping over it entirely.

![dropdowns](http://cl.ly/image/122R1v1y0t2t/Screen-Shot-2015-03-16-at-10.33.55-PM.jpg)

***

# **What can we learn from this?**
* User feedback is great - it will catch things you're too close to see
* It's okay to be wrong sometimes. It's the web, we can fix it!
* When you get feedback, try to find the root of the problem - that will lead you to the solution

***

<!-- background: #ff786c-->
<!-- color: #fff -->
# **"Okay, enough of that. I want to do something cool!"**

***

# **When is “cool” appropriate?**

***

# **The simple answer:**
Anytime it doesn’t interfere with your users or goals.

*Bonus if it supports them!*

***

<!-- background: #75b6d3-->
<!-- color: #fff -->
**How we did it:**
# **COM Pathfinder**

***

# **Problem: No one likes Communications degrees**
COM encompasses industries seen as
* “dying” (journalism)
* “near impossible to break into” (film/tv)
* “unstable/not a real job” (social media)
* Seen as a degree with unrealistic/no potential for jobs
Of course, we know that’s not true - the options just aren’t obvious.

***

# **How do we fix this?**

* People need to **know jobs exist**
* People need to see **proof of success** in those jobs
* People need to see the breadth of a degree in Communications is an advantage, not a disadvantage - there are many applications for a degree in Communications

Additionally, we know people in these positions are highly motivated and passionate.

***

# **This calls for something COOL.**

***

# **Idea one: The Quiz**
[Quiz wireframes link](http://www.bu.edu/webteam/projects/com/redesign2014/pathfinder/static/lf-homepage-1.html)

**The concept:** Tell us your strengths and interests, and we'll show you a list of careers you might be a good fit for.

This was a neat idea, but personalities change. We were concerned users may not recognize traits about themselves that others see… and accidentally section themselves off from good opportunities.

***

# **What we learned from The Quiz:** Our concept should be skills-based, not personality-based.

***

# **Idea two: The Game**

**The concept:** What if skills were elements you could combine to create careers? For example, what if Writing + Film = Screenwriter?

* If you indicate you’re interested in a parent skill (art), more skills would reveal themselves (design, painting, etc), so you’re “discovering” all the skills available to you.
* What careers will a user find with different combinations of skills? Could be a really motivating collection aspect to this ("I wonder what combinations lead to what careers")

Unfortunately, we couldn’t resolve this UI for mobile - it was small, cramped, and awkward feeling. We also didn't have a good solution for people just tossing in all the skills at once and cheating to discover everything.

***

# **What we learned from The Game:** This was probably my favorite idea, but way too complex to be realistic and usable. It was time to scale back a bit.

***

# **Idea three: “Do what you love, love what you do”**
[Mockup link](http://www.bu.edu/webteam/projects/com/redesign2014/mockups/round3/pathfinder-1.html)

**The concept:** People in this field are passionate about what they do, and the whole point of this piece is to connect people with careers they'll do well in. That should be the base of our message.

* Pick your skills on one side
* See what careers are a good match
* Easy, straightforward, and to the point
* Still “cool” because of the information we’re presenting and the animation

***

# **Finding inspiration for "cool" ideas**
* Think outside the website
* Hobbies, life experiences, something neat you saw - get away from your screen and think about what you do for fun, and how you can apply it to your design
* List stuff (you would be amazed at what you can come up with just listing out words related to what you’re working on)
* Look at things (Designer News, Codrops, UI Patterns)
* Find the root trouble you're tackling and the most interesting way you can tell people they’re wrong about that repeatedly

... and if all else fails ...

***

# **Make a bad joke, do something incredibly ridiculous, or whip up some extreme sarcasm and see where that takes you.**

Even if it's not something you can show, it's great to help break you out of a rut.

***

<!-- background: #43ac8b-->
<!-- color: #fff -->
# **Try it: Sketch your ideas**
Take the next 10 minutes to sketch preliminary prototypes for a new product that helps solve the problem you defined in your user profile. Create two pages:

* A landing page
* A dashboard for your user

You will need to include **space for ads** in your dashboard. Your landing page goal is to **sign up new users** for your product. Your sketches should include both mobile and desktop versions of your product.

***

# **Test your ideas and get feedback from the people around you**
There are many great ways to do this, but the important thing is to make sure you get this in front of people who aren't familiar with your idea and see how they react and how well they understand it. A few of my favorites:

* Talk through your idea and see if other people understand it (feel free to gesture wildly in the air as you do this)
* Quick sketches
* Paper prototypes
* Flat wireframes (Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop, whatever is fastest and basic)
* Quickly block it out in code (HTML/CSS/JS)
* Professional testing software, such as [OptimalWorkshop](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/)

***

# **Which methods should I use?**
All approaches are valid, and your approach will vary project by project. The best advice is to use whatever tools will get the job done quickly and effectively, so you can get your ideas in front of someone and tweak them until you get the functionality and layout right.

***

<!-- background: #43ac8b-->
<!-- color: #fff -->
# **Try it: User testing**
For the next 10 minutes, in pairs, take turns briefly explaining your product ideas and providing user feedback.

**Users:** Ask whatever you need to ask to fully understand your partner's idea and how it works.

**Designers:** Talk through your paper prototype. Ask your partner to tap where they would go to sign up on your landing page and how they would complete a task of your choice on your dashboard.

# **Special considerations for design on the web**

***

# **What you need to know for web**
Nearly all the stuff you know about print, plus:
* Making sure your layout works at multiple sizes seamlessly
* Making sure your content is legible at various screen distances
* Complying with accessibility standards and testing for colorblindness

***

# **Tips for a good responsive layout**
* Try designing mobile-first - the simplest, most basic layout first, and add design complexity as you move up in screen size
* If you can only show one thing on the screen at a time, what's the most crucial information to see first? What should users see next?

***

# **Your font size needs to be bigger**

**As a rule, body copy should not be smaller than 16px.** Increasingly, web designers are moving towards 18px as the new standard for readable body copy.

Think about how close your eyes are to a typical piece of paper. Then, think about how close your eyes are to your computer monitor now - or even your phone on the T. That difference in distance makes a significant difference in how type appears to you, and how hard it is to read.
[iA has a very good explanation of the phenomenon here.](https://ia.net/know-how/responsive-typography-the-basics)

***

# **While you're at it, increase your line height...**
The default browser line height isn't going to provide your body copy with the breathing room it needs to be readable. **In general, you should set body copy line-height to 1.4, and headline line-height to 1.2.**

Notice the lack of units - this is intentional. You want this to be a ratio based on your font size. That way, if you change your font size, the ratio stays the same.

***

# **... and wrangle your maximum width.**
Just as with print, there is an [ideal number of characters](http://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability) on each line for the most readable paragraph. You should set a max-width on your content to whatever this width ends up being for the font and sizes you choose.
![Max-width example](http://blog.froont.com/content/images/2014/11/07_Max-width-vx-No-max-width-1.gif "Courtesy of froont.com")
*Image courtesy [froont.com](http://blog.froont.com/9-basic-principles-of-responsive-web-design/)*

***

# **Selecting body copy for the web**
When selecting a font for your body copy, be sure to look for the following characteristics for optimum readability:
* A slightly higher x-height
* Good contrast for your color scheme - that is, make sure it's not too light or heavy
* At sizes smaller than 16px, a sans-serif font will likely be more readable

***

# **Source Sans Pro**
[Samaritan UX](https://twitter.com/samaritanux) has a solid explanation of why this makes such a great UI font, [if you want to get into the nitty gritty.](http://developers.samaritanministries.org/designers/styleguide/app-elements/typography/)

***

# **Designing for colorblindness**

* **Never rely solely on color** to distinguish different types of information
* Always include a secondary visual indicator, such as a label, icon, or shape/weight
* Make sure high priority information has high contrast
* Use contrasting colors to distinguish different areas or buttons/links you need to call out

[Learn more about why and how to design for colorblindness here.](http://www.usability.gov/get-involved/blog/2010/02/color-blindness.html)

***

# **Test your designs for colorblindness**
In Photoshop, go to View -> Proof Setup to select the type you want to preview, then use ⌘Y to toggle back and forth between colorblind simulation and your design.

***

# **Design best practices**
* Atomic design - build a library of small, reusable pieces, and carry design elements through the site to create consistency
* Have a plan for all the possibilities you can think of
* What happens on mobile?
* What happens if Javascript is disabled?
* What happens if a user’s browser doesn’t support certain styles or media types you’re using?
* and much, much more!
* Test, test, test and tweak the rest in code

***

# **Where you are doing something new and different, make sure you’re telling the user how it works**
[Example: If the Moon Were Only 1px](http://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html)

***

# **Checklist**
* Is there a clear, easy to understand path to the goal?
* Are there any “dead ends” in your design?
* Is it clear where you should look first, and where you should go from there?
* Did you label or explain any interactive elements that are new or uncommon?
* Did you read the content of at least one page in your site in your design?
